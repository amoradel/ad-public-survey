# Laravel-Survey
## Introduction
This is a very specific web app written to solve our need for quickly gathering
information from the public.  Because we wanted the forms to be quick, simple,
and integrated with our Active Directory domain for viewing results, we chose
to write this app.  Google Docs could likely meet your needs if you already use
them.

## Features
*  Active Directory authentication (via [Adldap2-Laravel](https://github.com/Adldap2/Adldap2-Laravel))
*  Export results to Excel (via [Laravel-Excel](https://github.com/Maatwebsite/Laravel-Excel))
*  Uses [Laravel](https://github.com/laravel/laravel)

## Installation
*  I think if you just clone this repo, run composer install, and edit config files it might work...
*  there's probably some Adldap2 steps too, in order to generate those config files.
*  Wow... that's kind of hard, I should really flesh this out.
*  I got it working on a server, but it took a bit of fiddling because I didn't know what I was doing.
